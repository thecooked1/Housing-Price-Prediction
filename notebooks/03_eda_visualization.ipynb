    "* **Geographical Impact:** The violin plot indicates that \"Inland\" properties have a significantly lower median price and less variance than properties closer to the coast.\n",
    "* **Derived Feature Value:** Our engineered feature Rooms_Per_Household shows a moderate relationship with price, offering more granularity than the raw total_rooms count.\n",
    "* **Price Capping:** The distribution analysis shows a slight accumulation at the higher end of the price scale, which is a characteristic of the California dataset's original collection method."
